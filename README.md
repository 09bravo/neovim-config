a semi-minimal neovim config

# Installation
first of all install [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug)
```

git clone https://github.com/olight0/nvim-config
cd nvim-config
mkdir ~/.config/nvim
mv init.vim ~/.config/nvim/
nvim
```
~nvim +PlugInstall~ (i tried on a fresh install of neovim it made it unusable because of the erorrs treesitter wont able to compile or something of that note i am not sure that point is DO NOT RUN it)

now that we made that clear, inside of neovim it will give you a bunch of errors just presse enter until the erorrs are gone then enter command mode (presse the ":" key) and enter the command ```PlugInstall```
